    <h1 id="vim">VIM…</h1>
<p>The Grey Beards’ ancient magic trump card of an editor.  Feared by many, adored by the masters.  This application has terrorized many computer scientist and made programmers petrified.  I have found a way to tame the beast within!</p>

<p>Ok, but seriously I hear those developers that say “VIM is too hard to learn.”  To be honest they are right.  VIM is weird and not like most editors.  Most people can’t figure out how to exit the program and it took even the best VIM users a few months to figure out most of it’s features.  Once you get past the steep learning curve there is a lot of good reasons to use it though.</p>

<p>For starters VIM runs everywhere.  Windows users you can use VIM.  Mac users VIM works for you as well. No Apple Care required.  And for my fellow Linux users we also get to enjoy VIM.  Do you need an editor while SSHing into a server?  VIM does that.  Do you need a lightweight editor to run on old hardware?  VIM for you too.  Want an editor for your Android Phone?  VIM has an app for that.</p>

<p>VIM is customizable.  VIM starts as a simple text editor, but it evolves into so much more with the use of plugins.  <a href="https://vimawesome.com/">Vim Awesome</a> has tons of plugins that allow you to make VIM into anything that you want.  It can handle most features of modern IDEs and it can do it from ther terminal.  Make it into whatever you need.</p>

<p>I could go on and on all day long about a million other reasons that VIM is awesome.  Chances are eventually even if you don’t want to you will need to use it.  In college I never learned VIM because I didn’t think I would ever use it.  But now I can see what a fool I was for thinking that I would never need it.  Now I can’t see developing without it.</p>

<h1 id="vimpossible">Vimpossible</h1>
<p>So what is Vimpossible?  Vimpossible is a basic vimrc configuration that I built for my friends and coworkers who don’t usually use VIM.  Vimpossible boldly attempts to create a base vimrc file that will make the process of getting started a little bit easier.</p>

<p>So what makes Vimpossible so special in comparison with other vimrc configurations?  Vimpossible tries to keep the customization and features added really basic so the user can expand on the toolset as they see fit.  Vimpossible doesn’t try to make assumptions and do everything, but instead removes some of the hurdles of getting started and stays out of the way of the user’s customization.</p>

<h1 id="plugins">Plugins</h1>

<h2 id="nerdtree">Nerdtree</h2>
<p>Nerdtree is an amazing addition to any VIM configuration.  It allows you to have a file browser built into VIM that makes it feel like other editors that new VIM users would be use to.  Traversing folders, and selecting files has never been easier in VIM.  Additionally Vimpossible enables the mouse if possible to allow the user to use the mouse to navigate.  Nerdtree tabs adds better support for switching tabs with Nerdtree and Nerdtree git allows the user to see git file change indicators next to the files in a git repository.</p>

<h2 id="simplemenu">Simplemenu</h2>
<p>This is a great gem that I only found after hours of searching.  Simplemenu allows a user to create custom menus for hard to remember commands using the &lt;leader&gt; m key combination.  By default leader is usually the ‘\’ key so the key presses would be ‘\’, and then ‘m’.  This will open a small context menu that by default comes prebuilt with some fugitive commands built into an example menu.</p>

<h2 id="fugitive">Fugitive</h2>
<p>Fugitive is an amazing plugin that integrates GIT version control into VIM.  For people like me who always use git as their version control it is a life saver.  No more navigating out of VIM to make commits on the command line.  It is now all built into the amazing editor VIM.</p>

<h1 id="configuration">Configuration</h1>
<p>Vimpossible comes with a few additional default configuration features.  The most notable feature is that Vimpossible enables the mouse.  This will allow new VIM users to adjust slowly to the VIM navigation system.  It also has some compatiblity features added for running all of the plugins and ensuring the VIM colors show up the correct way.  The configuration is held inside of the vimrc file which is very basic but can be changed into whatever you need it to be.</p>

<p>Neovim support is added through the .config directory.</p>

<h1 id="sign-off">Sign off</h1>
<p>I will continue to build and add features to Vimpossible and if it makes one person’s transition into VIM easier it has made the entire project worth it.  VIM runs everywhere so chances are everyone will see it at somepoint.  Vimpossible will continue to make those experiences where you have to use VIM better and hey maybe even one day you might find that Vimpossible did the impossible and made you a VIM convert.</p>
