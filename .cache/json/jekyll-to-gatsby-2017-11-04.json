            "html": "<p>The world of static site generators is really interesting right now.  There are hundreds of them out currently.  If you don’t believe me go take a look at this list of <a href=\"https://staticsitegenerators.net/\">Static Site Generators</a>.  Right now the definitive king of them all is <a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/\">Jekyll</a> right now.  Jekyll is great with a really quick easy spin up and a really large support community of plugins and themes.</p>\n<h2>Down with the King</h2>\n<p>However, when I used Jekyll it just began to seem really incomplete and clunky to me.  I started by creating this blog site running on Jekyll and the default theme worked fantastic.  Shortly after I decided I wanted to change the theme to and hit a road block immediately.  The theme I wanted to use wouldn’t work because it was built for an older version of Jekyll.  I couldn’t help but think haven’t we solved this problem in modern day JavaScript.  Shouldn’t replacing pieces of a theme be just like replacing a web component.  It thought why isn’t it that easy.</p>\n<p>I also found myself scratching my head when trying to work with plugins.  This is not Jekyll’s fault, but my own.  Jekyll relies on GEM to install the plugins which is an amazing package manager for the Ruby community.  The only problem was, I’m not a part of the Ruby community.  This was kind of deal breaker for me because in order to continue to develop my site I would have to teach myself the language and tools of the Ruby language.</p>\n<p>And last but not least the templates were weird.  You would write blog post in a series of markdown files and the remainder of the templates were in something called liquid.  It worked ok but it just didn’t feel right.  And if you wanted to include repetitive HTML content in multiple places you could, but it wasn’t elegant.  It felt a lot like a PHP include.  What I really desired was building web components to complete this task and it just wasn’t there..</p>\n<h2>I’ll do it Myself</h2>\n<p>So I started writing my own Static Site Generator at first.  I figured there are already hundreds what is one more.  I started building a Static Site Generator based on <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\">React</a> as the templating engine.  This was great because it was based in JavaScript which everyone knows and React which is loved by so many modern developers.  </p>\n<h2>Great Gatsby!</h2>\n<p>I got through the initial generation of my static site when I found <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/\">Gatsby</a> and wow I was impressed.  The Gatsby team had done exactly what I was trying to do with a really cool development stack.  I imediately switch gears and started work on this custom Gatsby site instead of continuing my development and I am happily not looking back.</p>\n<h1>What is so Great About Gatsby</h1>\n<p>So like most things this is going to come down to opinion.  It is not the Jekyll is not great, but Jekyll is certainly not for me.  Gatsby was a great natural progression because I already knew the JavaScript stack well and it was using the technology stack that I wanted to use in my dream site generator.  This meant that I wouldn’t have to spend time learning Ruby, which at this time is not high on my list of languages I am interested in (no offense Ruby community).  But on a deeper dive into the technology behind Gatsby I found some really interesting gems in the code.</p>\n<h2>Hotloading</h2>\n<p>Gatsby has a feature known as hot reloading.  This means that as you develop your site and React components your site will automatically incorporate these changes into your site without needing a page refresh.  This meant while I sat in my living room I could cast my website live to my living room TV and watch as my changes appeared on the screen.  It was super convenient as I was trying to develop the Social react component and get it to look right.</p>\n<h2>React-Blog-Template</h2>\n<p>So Gatsby comes with a really simple <a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog\">blog template</a> by Kyle Matthews.  To be honest it isn’t as good as Jekyll’s <a href=\"https://github.com/jekyll/minima\">default theme</a>, but what it lacks in complexity it makes up for in ease of customization.  In a few hours I was able to build my own custom page templates for my Gatsby site using <a href=\"https://react-bootstrap.github.io/\">React Bootstrap</a>, <a href=\"https://bootswatch.com/\">Bootswatch</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/AVVS/react-social-icons\">Social Icons</a>, and a few other libraries.  I also liked the way the project was divided more as it wasn’t trying to import sections of HTML like we used to do 10 years ago.  Instead it allowed me to write components and include pieces of web pages through React.</p>\n<h2>Easy Deployment</h2>\n<p>Gatsby uses <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages\">gh-pages</a> to deploy your project to Github Pages easily.  They even have some great <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/deploy-gatsby/\">documentation</a> on the Gatsby site that walks you through the process.</p>\n<h2>Bonus</h2>\n<p>There were a few gems I also found when reading through the code of Gatsby as well.  I found <a href=\"https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet\">react-helmet</a> which allows you to customize your head metadata on Single Page App sites and <a href=\"http://graphql.org/\">GraphQL</a> which is used to write some amazing queries in the backbone of Gatsby.</p>\n<h1>Wrap up</h1>\n<p>Gatsby has been a breath of fresh air for me when it comes to building and mainting a static site.  I am looking forward to this platform to continue to evolve and I really think the Gatsby team has done some really good job so far.  Jekyll is great, but if you are by chance looking for a change or you really love React like me give Gatsby a go.  I think you will be really impressed with what you see.</p>",
